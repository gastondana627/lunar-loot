## My Recommendation

**Start with Version 1 prompt in Freepik AI**

If the moon doesn't show up clearly:
1. Try Version 2 (more detailed)
2. Or use Canva manual approach
3. Or hire a quick designer on Fiverr ($5-10, 24 hours)

The key is maintaining that crescent moon branding element that makes your game unique!
