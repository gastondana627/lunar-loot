# 🤚 Gesture Detection Fix

## Current Issues

The heart gesture detection is too strict. Let's simplify it.

## Simplified Gesture System

### Option 1: Peace Sign (V) - Easiest to detect
- Index and middle finger extended
- Other fingers curled
- Very reliable detection
- +50 points

### Option 2: Open Palm - Very easy
- All fingers extended
- Hand flat facing camera
- +30 points

### Option 3: Fist - Simple
- All fingers curled
- +20 points

## Recommended: Keep thumbs up, add peace sign

The thumbs up for Chroma Awards is good.
Add peace sign as the main easter egg - it's much easier to detect than heart gesture.

## Implementation Priority

1. **Thumbs Up** (already working) - +100 points, Chroma shoutout
2. **Peace Sign** (new, easy) - +50 points, fun effect
3. **Remove heart gesture** (too unreliable with single camera)

Would you like me to implement the peace sign gesture instead of the heart?
It will be much more reliable and fun to trigger!
