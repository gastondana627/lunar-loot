## Technical Discussion Version:

**Lunar Loot - Computer Vision Game for Chroma Awards**

Built a browser-based hand tracking game using MediaPipe. Some interesting technical challenges:

**Stack:**
- Streamlit for web deployment
- MediaPipe Hands for landmark detection
- OpenCV for video processing
- Custom gesture recognition for easter eggs

**Challenges solved:**
- Real-time performance (30+ FPS with CV processing)
- Gesture reliability (switched from heart to peace/thumbs)
- Cross-device compatibility
- Browser camera permissions

**Try it:** [URL]
**Source:** [GitHub]

Open to questions about the implementation! Also left feedback for organizers about adding a dedicated CV category - I think it deserves recognition alongside VR given its accessibility and real-world applications.
