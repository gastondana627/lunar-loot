### 2. Optional: Generate Custom UI Images

**Prompts ready:** See `UI_IMAGE_PROMPTS.md`

**Time estimate:** 3-6 hours total
- Generate images: 1-2 hours

3. Generate UI images in parallel

## Your Decision

**Option A: Deploy Now (Recommended)**
- Takes 5 minutes
- Test in production immediately
- Submit to competition
- Add UI images later if desired

**Option B: Generate UI Images First**
- Takes 3-6 hours more
- More polished final product
- Better Freepik integration
- Deploy after completion

**My recommendation:** Deploy now (Option A), then work on UI images in parallel. You can always redeploy with enhanced UI later.
